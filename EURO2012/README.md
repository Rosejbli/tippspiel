# tippspiel
## EURO 2012

This is the version of tippspiel that ran during the EURO 2012. In order to avoid false expectations, allow me to say one or two things about it.
There is **no localization**. Although I write my code in English, you will encounter some sentences of German, as all players were, in fact, from Germany.
Everything was kept _really_ simple and implemented in a short period of time. Here are some features/technologies, that I'd like to use in future versions:
 * BCrypt instead of salted SHA hashes
 * Safer forms (make sure forms are submitted from within the app...)
 * Richer user-profiles
 * Better/richer/safer session management
 * A better scoring system

Please let me know if you have any suggestions or found some bugs.
