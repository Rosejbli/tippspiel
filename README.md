# tippspiel

An online game of betting on football matches. The game currently runs on [sircoemgen.pythonanywhere.com](http://sircoemgen.pythonanywhere.com/). The source code will be published here after the EURO2012.

After publishing the code, I will probably modify it for the upcoming Bundesliga season. If you want to participate in this, please let me know.
